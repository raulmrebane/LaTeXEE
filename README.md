# LaTeXEE
Project for course "Software Project": Extraction and checking of LaTeX mathematics

### What it does  

LaTeXEE is a command-line only application which parses a valid .tex document, which contains [special \declare commands](https://github.com/Abercus/LaTeXEE/wiki/Declaration-language), parses the mathematical formulas inside the document, and outputs an OpenMath .xml file. A more detailed overview of the process can be found [here.](https://github.com/Abercus/LaTeXEE/wiki/Parsing-process-specification)
